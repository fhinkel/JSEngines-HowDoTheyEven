# The JavaScript Engine in Node.js: TurboFan and Ignition
[Slides from NodeFest 2017](https://fhinkel.github.io/JSEngines-HowDoTheyEven/NodeFest).

V8 is the JavaScript engine in Node.js. Since Node 8.3, we use V8’s new compiler pipeline with TurboFan and Ignition. How can V8 be so fast and how does a Just-in-time compiler work? 
We’ll look at basic and not-so-basic concepts of V8 and discuss what TurboFan, the optimizing compiler, means for Node.js performance. You’ll learn how to write code that’s fast with the new compiler pipeline.

Want to know how JavaScript engines work? Why is JavaScript so fast? What is just-in-time compilation? We’ll look at basic concepts of compilers, challenges posed by modern JavaScript, and how to write compiler-friendly JavaScript.
